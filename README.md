# QueueingRabbit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/temochka/queueing_rabbit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/temochka/queueing_rabbit) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/temochka/queueing_rabbit.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/temochka/queueing_rabbit)

QueueingRabbit provides a Ruby DSL to interact with RabbitMQ. It is fairly flexible and allows you to integrate with existing infrastructure and naming conventions. It currently supports [bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny) as a back-end.

## Disclaimer

I built this gem at [Wildbit](http://wildbit.com) in 2012. Back then there weren’t any solid generic queueing systems targeting RabbitMQ for Ruby. The gem was open-sourced in early 2013, but I never put any effort into selling it to the community. Even though the gem is working, maintained, and is still used by Wildbit in production, in the long run you should be better with now-existing mainstream alternatives like [hutch](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch) and [sneakers](https://github.com/jondot/sneakers).

## Example

The following Ruby program publishes an excerpt of Joseph Brodsky’s poem line by line to a RabbitMQ exchange and prints received messages on the screen.

``` ruby
require 'queueing_rabbit'

class Reciter < QueueingRabbit::AbstractJob

  def perform
    puts payload
  end

end

worker = QueueingRabbit::Worker.new(Reciter)

poem = <<-
  I said fate plays a game without a score,
  and who needs fish if you've got caviar?
  The triumph of the Gothic style would come to pass
  and turn you on - no need for coke, or grass.
  I sit by the window. Outside, an aspen.
  When I loved, I loved deeply. It wasn't often.


Thread.new {
  poem.each_line { |l| Reciter.enqueue(l) }
  sleep 5
  worker.stop
}

worker.work!
```

This code has following important side effects:

* A Rabbit queue named `Reciter` is created with default options (if not exists).
* 6 messages are published to the default exchange with routing key `Reciter`.
* 6 messages are consumed from the `Reciter` queue.
* 6 lines of the poem are printed to STDOUT.

## Documentation & Support

Check out the [project wiki](https://github.com/temochka/queueing_rabbit/wiki) for additional guidance. If you have questions or something doesn’t work for you, feel free to file issues.

## Installation

QueueingRabbit supports MRI Ruby version 1.9.3 and above. It is still compliant with Ruby 1.8.7, but some features may not work as expected and the compatibility will be removed in the near future.

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'queueing_rabbit'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it globally as:

    $ gem install queueing_rabbit


## Special Thanks

* [Wildbit](http://wildbit.com) — for letting me open source this library initially developed for the internal use.
* [RabbitMQ client libraries for Ruby](https://github.com/ruby-amqp) — for providing outstanding well-documented gems that made this project possible.
